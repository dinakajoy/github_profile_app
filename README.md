# github_profile_app

## Description
This is a simple application where users can create cardlist of registered users on github and view thier github details. It consumes github's API. This is my first react application and since we mostly keep our front-end separate from the logics and only allow communicate between app user interface and logics via API, I decided to build on that skill since that's what most of the tasks entails  

## Installation
Clone the repository and cd into the project directory  
Run `npm install`     
To deploy, run `npm run build` and copy the build folder to your server      

## Usage
Simply enter the github username and click add   
To view more github user's details, click on the card

## Built With
* React - For Layout 
* CSS - For Styling 
* Consumes github's API
